/*
What is Hash Table?

A hash table is a data structure which helps us to quickly find the data by using the keys.
Hash table uses the hash function to generate the indexes sometimes hash function generates
the same index for the different data this is called collision.

Definition:
A dictionary in which keys are mapped to array positions by hash functions.
Having the keys of more than one item map to the same position is called a collision.
There are many collision resolution schemes, but they may be divided into open addressing,
chaining, and keeping one special overflow area. Perfect hashing avoids collisions
but may be time-consuming to create.

If the collision occurs there are different ways to resolve the collisions.
1. Linear Probing
2. Separate Chaining
3. coalesced chaining
4. double hashing
5. quadratic probing

In this tutorial, we are using separate chaining to resolve the collisions.
Letâ€™s implement the algorithm.
