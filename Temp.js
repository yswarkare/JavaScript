			`Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

			Example 1:

			Input: 121

			Output: true

			Example 2:

			Input: -121

			Output: false

			Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

			Example 3:

			Input: 10

			Output: false

			Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

			Follow up:

			Coud you solve it without converting the integer to a string?`

			Input: [3,2,3]

			Output: 3

			If the last word does not exist, return 0.
